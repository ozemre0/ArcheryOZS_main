## Guidelines for AI Assistants

### DO's

1. Code Structure
- Always suggest implementing the MVVM or Clean Architecture pattern
- Recommend creating separate files for models, views, and controllers
- Emphasize proper folder structure organization
- Encourage use of type safety and null safety

2. State Management
- Promote Riverpod usage for state management
- Suggest creating providers for different features
- Recommend implementing proper state immutability

3. Database Design
- Reference the provided Supabase schema
- Ensure proper relationship handling between tables
- Suggest optimized queries for better performance

4. Authentication
- Focus on secure implementation of authentication flows
- Recommend proper token management
- Suggest implementing proper role-based access control

5. Error Handling
- Always include proper error handling in code snippets
- Suggest implementing error boundaries
- Recommend user-friendly error messages

### DON'Ts

1. Code Quality
- Don't suggest using deprecated Flutter widgets or methods
- Avoid recommending setState for complex state management
- Don't skip error handling in code examples

2. Architecture
- Don't mix business logic with UI code
- Avoid suggesting global state when local state is sufficient
- Don't recommend anti-patterns like singleton abuse

3. Database
- Don't suggest direct database modifications without proper validation
- Avoid recommending complex queries when simple ones would suffice
- Don't skip implementing proper database indexes

4. Security
- Don't suggest storing sensitive data in plain text
- Avoid recommending client-side-only validation
- Don't skip implementing proper authorization checks

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core Features (Must be implemented first)
- Authentication system
- User profile management
- Basic navigation structure
- Role-based access control

2. Training Features
- Training session creation
- Score tracking
- Performance analytics
- Photo upload system

3. Competition Features
- Tournament creation
- Elimination rounds management
- Live scoring system
- Bracket visualization

4. Communication Features
- Messaging system
- Notifications
- Announcements
- Club management

## Code Quality Standards

1. Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Follow Flutter/Dart naming conventions
- Keep consistency in naming across the project

2. Documentation
- Include comments for complex logic
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Maintain README files for each module

3. Testing
- Suggest unit tests for business logic
- Recommend widget tests for UI components
- Include integration tests for critical flows

## Performance Considerations

1. UI Performance
- Implement lazy loading for lists
- Use const constructors where possible
- Implement proper widget rebuilding optimization

2. Database Performance
- Suggest proper indexing
- Recommend query optimization
- Implement efficient data caching

3. Network Performance
- Implement proper data pagination
- Suggest offline support where needed
- Recommend proper data synchronization strategies

## Security Guidelines

1. Authentication
- Implement proper token management
- Use secure storage for sensitive data
- Implement proper session management

2. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement proper access control
- Follow data protection regulations

3. Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before storage
- Implement proper error messages

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Architecture Mistakes
- Mixing business logic with UI
- Poor state management implementation
- Inadequate error handling

2. Performance Issues
- Loading too much data at once
- Inefficient list rendering
- Poor image optimization

3. Security Risks
- Storing sensitive data insecurely
- Skipping proper validation
- Insufficient access control

## Response Format

When providing assistance:
1. Always start with understanding the specific requirement
2. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
3. Provide code examples with explanations
4. Include error handling in code snippets
5. Suggest test cases where applicable
6. Mention potential pitfalls to avoid

## Project-Specific Notes

1. Role System
- Always consider the different user roles when suggesting implementations
- Ensure proper access control in all features
- Consider role-specific UI requirements

2. Competition System
- Pay special attention to the elimination round logic
- Ensure accurate scoring system implementation
- Consider real-time updates for live scoring

3. Training System
- Focus on accurate data collection
- Consider offline functionality
- Implement proper progress tracking

4. Club Management
- Consider hierarchical access control
- Implement proper member management
- Consider payment tracking features

Remember to provide step-by-step guidance and always consider the context of the archery sport when suggesting implementations.
